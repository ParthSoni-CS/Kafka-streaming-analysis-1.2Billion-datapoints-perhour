# Kafka 1.2 Billion Data Points/Hour Streaming Pipeline

This project demonstrates a high-throughput data streaming workflow using Apache Kafka capable of handling approximately 1.2 billion data points per hour. It shows how to set up producers, configure Kafka, and implement real-time processing with a stream processing framework (e.g., Spark or Kafka Streams), all while ensuring scalability and fault-resilience.

## Overview
- **Massive Data Handling**: Streams up to 1.2 billion data points per hour.  
- **Real-Time Processing**: Uses Kafkaâ€™s publish-subscribe model and a processing layer (Spark or Kafka Streams) for swift transformations.  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easily onboard more brokers and partitions as load increases.  
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensure continuity through data replication and failover handling.

## Key Components
1. **Producers**  
   - Generate or collect data (e.g., logs, sensor data) and publish to Kafka topics.

2. **Kafka Cluster**  
   - Distributes data among brokers.  
   - Provides parallel processing via topic partitions.  
   - Replicates data for reliability.

3. **Stream Processors**  
   - Processes incoming data for transformations, enrichment, or aggregation.

4. **Consumers**  
   - Reads processed data from Kafka for downstream applications or storage.

## Features
- **High Throughput**: Efficiently manages massive ingest rates.  
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling of brokers and partitions.  
- **Configurable**: Flexible topic settings, consumer groups, and partitioning strategies.  
- **Integration**: Compatible with widely used data stores, analytics tools, and microservices.
